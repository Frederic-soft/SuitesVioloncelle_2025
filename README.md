This is a transcription of Bach's cello suites for bass clarinet.

It was made from several sources available on [IMSLP] (https://imslp.org):
* [a manuscript by Anna Magdalena Bach](https://imslp.org/wiki/6_Cello_Suites%2C_BWV_1007-1012_(Bach%2C_Johann_Sebastian)#IMSLP512542)
* [an edition by Alfred Dörffel](https://imslp.org/wiki/6_Cello_Suites%2C_BWV_1007-1012_(Bach%2C_Johann_Sebastian)#IMSLP12165)
* [a manuscript by Johann Peter Kellner](https://imslp.org/wiki/6_Cello_Suites%2C_BWV_1007-1012_(Bach%2C_Johann_Sebastian)#IMSLP325883)

The `Cello` directory contains an encoding in the [ABC music file format](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(notation)) of the suites, as well as a [LaTeX](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) document to generate a booklet of the notation. The rendering of the ABC notation is made using [abc2svg by Jean-François Moine](http://moinejf.free.fr/).

The `Clarinet` directory contains a transcription of the suites for bass clarinet. It uses the same format and tools to encode and render the notation.

The rendering process relies on some tools that I developed to harness the power of abc2svg and to integrate ABC notation in a LaTeX document. These tools are available on [Github](github.com/Frederic-soft/abc2svgstuff).
